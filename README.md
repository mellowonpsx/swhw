Assignment:

Develop a smal (web) aplication for storing bachelor projects: each project wil have a tile,
a short description, keywords, a cordinator (with name, e-mail adres etc), students
working at that project (name, e-mail adres etc). The aplication is designed for students
and cordinators.
Students can:
- log in;
- see the list of al projects;
- search using:
      - keywords;
      - cordinator name;
      - available projects (each project has a maximum number of registered students);
- register for a project: the cordinator receives an e-mail with the request;
- receive e-mail if acepted.

Cordinators can:
- log in;
- see the list of al projects;
- see the list of his/her projects;
- add a student o one of his/her projects.

You can implement the aplication in any language you want, but you have to use at least
two XML technologies (e.g. XSLT,XPATH, XQUERY), for storing date and/or for
sending/receiving data.

Write a short report describing it, which has to contain:
  - scope
  - architecture 
  - use of xml (functions/methods specifc to the language in which you develop the application)

You may work in pairs (teams of 2). The grade wil be put taking into acount the extent of use and the degre of dificulty
related to XML technologies.
Ways to obtain a bonus or work in teams of 3:
- select XML related technologies which weren't presented at he course (e.g. SVG);
- make a web service or a web search facilty (with meaning for the given project);
- for cordinators: implementhe ad/edit/delete project functionalites;
